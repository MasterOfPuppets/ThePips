<h1>The Pips</h1>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I commute every day to work, always listening to music with my android phone and I don't like wearing a watch, so the need to know the time comes once in a while. That's why I made "The Pips" - to be notified that time is ticking.</p>
<h3>What you can do with it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set the notification interval, you can choose one of three levels (one hour, half hour or fifteen minutes.</li>
<li>You can choose to be notified only when phones are plugged in or be always notified.</li>
<li>You can use the built in pips (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Time_Signal">wikipedia page</a>)</li>
<li>... or your phone usual notifications.</li>
<li>... or you can set the pips to be different at each quarter</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>Being a programmer, the ideas never stop. I have lot's of features in my head to build in "The Pips", but first I will enjoy this lean start, listen to comments and then we will see.</p>
